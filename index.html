    <h1 class="header">WHAT DOES 'FOOD FOR ALL' MEAN AT TACO BELL?</h1>
    
    <p>At Taco Bell, when we say “we're feeding peoples' lives with unexpected good,” we mean it.

        We make bold food you can't get anywhere else. It's food that ignites passion. It's food you want to talk about. It's food that you've got to have and can't wait to eat again. And it always delivers more for your money.
        
        For 15 years, we've been on a journey evolving our menu to provide food that's customizable to fit your lifestyle and to leave a lighter footprint on the communities around us. We use ingredients that are simple to understand, without sacrificing flavor. Whether you're looking for options that are vegetarian*, made without gluten**, high protein, lower calorie or fat, or in the mood for something indulgent, Taco Bell has food for all. Check out some of our favorite ways to eat Taco Bell for any lifestyle:</p>

    <h1 class="header">WE BELIEVE TRANSPARENCY IS KEY.</h1>

    <p>We're not big on secrets. That's why, we always make it easy to learn what's in your food. Back in 2005, we were one of the first quick service restaurants to post full nutrition information and ingredient statements online. Since then, we have incorporated a (V) symbol on our menuboards in restaurants to remove the guesswork for our vegetarian customers and help them locate options that fit their lifestyle. We have also expanded our website to include allergen information and a nutrition calculator to help you find options and customize your own creations to fit your lifestyle and make an informed decision. Check out our online tools and resources:</p>

        <li>FAQS</li>
    </ul>

    
<h1 class="header">WE USE HIGH QUALITY, SUSTAINABLE INGREDIENTS.</h1>

<p>For us, it's not enough to offer affordable, craveable, innovative choices. It also has to be food you feel good about, made with ingredients you can understand. Over the years, we've made significant improvements to our food to offer you just that. While we continue to challenge ourselves to push the boundaries further, some of our biggest U.S. milestones so far include:</p>

    <ul class="par2">
        <li>Simplifying our ingredients: We removed artificial flavors and colors and replaced them with natural alternatives, where possible, and we removed artificial trans fat and high fructose corn syrup.</li>

        <li>Sourcing sustainable palm oil: We have removed any unsustainable palm oil from our food and are committed to only sourcing sustainable palm oil moving forward.</li>
        
        <li>Using 100% cage-free eggs: Whether you're ordering eggs in one of our delicious breakfast burritos or ordering something else later in the day (including limited time offerings) that uses eggs as an ingredient, rest assured that we only source 100% cage-free eggs*** in all U.S. and Canada restaurants. We even received the Good Egg Award in 2020, awarded by Compassion in World Farming, for this very thing.</li>
       
        <li>Sourcing quality proteins: We have been committed to sourcing chicken raised without antibiotics important to human medicine since 2017, and we are working to reduce antibiotics important to human medicine in our beef supply.</li>

    <p>But, she can't do it alone. She leads a small but mighty team of four, including a second registered dietitian, Marissa.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Marissa, North America Nutrition Specialist, is the second-ever in-house dietitian at Taco Bell. Over the past four years, she has spearheaded the launch of the Food for All Fam - a network of registered dietitians who help Taco Bell keep our finger on the pulse of issues that are important to our guests, like reducing added sugars and sodium in our food. She led Taco Bell's commitment to offer better beverages, and received the Produce Excellence in Foodservice award in 2020 for her innovative use of produce across the menu. Always cooking up something delicious and innovative in the test kitchen, she leads product development of the vegetarian menu and is the proud creator of the Black Bean Crunchwrap Supreme. Her favorite menu hack is ordering the Cheesy Gordita Crunch online and customizing it by 'making it vegetarian' to swap seasoned beef for black beans and adding tomatoes.</p>

    <h5>*Taco Bell's vegetarian menu items are certified by the American Vegetarian Association are lacto-ovo, allowing consumption of dairy and eggs but not animal byproducts. We may use the same frying oil to prepare menu items that could contain meat. Vegetarian and meat ingredients are handled in common, and cross contact may occur, which may not be acceptable to certain types of vegetarian diets. Neither Taco Bell®, our employees, our franchisees nor the AVA assume any responsibility for such cross contact.</h5>

    <h5>** Taco Bell does not claim “gluten-free” for any of its food. Some Taco Bell items are made without gluten containing ingredients, but are prepared in common kitchen areas, including common fryer oil, risking gluten exposure. Taco Bell does not recommend products for people with celiac disease. People with gluten intolerances or sensitivities should exercise judgment when ordering. Talk to your healthcare professional about what Taco Bell items are right for you.
